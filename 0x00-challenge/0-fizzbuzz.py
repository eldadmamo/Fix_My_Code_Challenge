The issue with your implementation of FizzBuzz in Python is that you're checking for multiples of 3 before checking for multiples of both 3 and 5. As a result, when the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 (i.e., 15), it satisfies the first condition (`(i % 3) == 0`) and prints "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz".

To fix this issue, you should check for multiples of both 3 and 5 before checking for multiples of 3 alone. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" FizzBuzz
"""
import sys

def fizzbuzz(n):
    """
    FizzBuzz function prints numbers from 1 to n separated by a space.
    - For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for
      multiples of five print "Buzz".
    - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
    """
    if n < 1:
        return
    tmp_result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if (i % 3) == 0 and (i % 5) == 0:  # Check for multiples of both 3 and 5 first
            tmp_result.append("FizzBuzz")
        elif (i % 3) == 0:
            tmp_result.append("Fizz")
        elif (i % 5) == 0:
            tmp_result.append("Buzz")
        else:
            tmp_result.append(str(i))
    print(" ".join(tmp_result))
    if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) <= 1:
        print("Missing number")
        print("Usage: ./0-fizzbuzz.py <number>")
        print("Example: ./0-fizzbuzz.py 89")
        sys.exit(1)
        number = int(sys.argv[1])
    fizzbuzz(number)
```
